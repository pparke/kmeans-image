# K Means Image Filter

## [See it here](https://pparke.github.io/kmeans-image)

While reading [AIFH](http://www.heatonresearch.com/aifh/) I decided to explore the chapter on K-Means by creating a basic image manipulation app.  Dropping an image onto the page will begin clustering the colors in the image based on their rgb and xy values.
You can set the number of clusters (K) and the number of iterations.  Varying these will cause different effects ranging from a two tone
sketch to a patchy divisionist style.  You can also stop the process at any point by pressing the stop button or restart it to generate
a different result.
